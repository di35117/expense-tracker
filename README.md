Implementation Details
Local Storage
All expense data is stored in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that information is retained between sessions.

Expense Handling
Expenses are stored as an array of objects, each with a unique identifier, a name, and a numeric amount.

Dynamic UI Updates
The interface updates automatically when an expense is added or removed, including recalculating the total.

Customization Options
The UI gradient and colors can be easily adjusted via styles.css.

Input validation can be extended for advanced constraints (e.g., maximum amount, allowed characters).

Additional features like category tags, filters, or date tracking can be integrated into the existing structure.
